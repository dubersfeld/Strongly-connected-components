# Strongly-connected-components
Java based demonstration of Strongly Connected Components Search on an oriented graph using Depth First Search algorithm.

I present here a Java based demonstration of a Strongly Connected Components algorithm that uses a Depth First Search algorithm.

The algorithm itself is implemented in Java. Javascript is used for random initialization and display on Canvas only.

When deployed on Tomcat the root context is strongly-connected components.
